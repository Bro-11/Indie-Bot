# Indie-Bot
A self-hosted bot made for smaller Discord communities

## Set-Up Guide (Work In Progress)
#### (This was made with self-hosting in mind)

### Find an IDE
#### This is just what I use lol
I personally use PyCharm Community Edition which you can find [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), but any IDE *should* work.
I'll be using PyCharm for this guide.

### Install The Libraries and FFMPEG
#### You can't run it without these
Press ALT+F12 to open up the console.
Paste in this and click enter:
```pip install discord.py os yt-dlp itertools asyncio```
