## Set-Up Guide (Work In Progress)
#### (This was made with self-hosting in mind)

### Find an IDE
#### This is just what I use lol
I personally use PyCharm Community Edition which you can find [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), but any IDE *should* work.
I'll be using PyCharm for this guide.

### Install The Libraries and FFMPEG
#### You can't run it without these
Press ALT+F12 to open up the console.
Paste in this and click enter:
``pip install discord.py os yt-dlp itertools asyncio``

### Fill In Bot Token
Go generate and/or find your bot token at the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  Copy that token and paste it in the .env file after the ``DISCORD_TOKEN=``

### Press Start!
#### You're all set!
Press ``Shift+F10`` or the green start button in the window bar.
